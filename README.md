# Sentiment-Analysis
**Sentiment Analysis with Naive Bayes:** This project uses Scikit-Learn to classify sentiments (positive, negative, neutral) in text using a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier. TF-IDF vectorization transforms text data for training, prediction, and accuracy evaluation. An essential example for understanding sentiment analysis.
**Sentiment Analysis using Naive Bayes Classifier**

This project demonstrates sentiment analysis using a Naive Bayes classifier on text data. Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing (NLP) task that involves determining the emotional tone or sentiment expressed in a piece of text. The goal of this project is to classify text data into positive, negative, or neutral sentiment categories.

**Features:**
- Utilizes the Scikit-Learn library for machine learning tasks.
- Implements a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier for sentiment classification.
- Uses TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization to transform text data into numerical features.
- Splits the dataset into training and testing sets for model evaluation.
- Calculates and displays the accuracy of the sentiment classification model.

**Steps:**
1. Load the dataset containing text samples and corresponding sentiment labels.
2. Split the data into training and testing sets.
3. Initialize a TF-IDF vectorizer to transform the text data into numerical features.
4. Fit and transform the training text data using the TF-IDF vectorizer.
5. Transform the testing text data using the same vectorizer.
6. Initialize and train a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier on the transformed training data.
7. Predict sentiment labels on the testing data using the trained classifier.
8. Evaluate the model's accuracy by comparing predicted labels with actual labels.

This project provides a simple example of sentiment analysis using a Naive Bayes classifier and TF-IDF vectorization. It can serve as a starting point for understanding text classification and sentiment analysis tasks. The code is easy to understand and can be adapted for more complex scenarios or different datasets.

Feel free to explore, modify, and enhance this project to experiment with different classifiers, vectorization techniques, and datasets for sentiment analysis tasks.
